However, since the completion of the 1.8-kilometre long sea tunnel, it became the central hub of the two places and introduced connections. The main financial and commercial areas on both sides of the picturesque Victoria Harbour provide great benefits to people while enjoying the beauty of the two places</p>

                                <p>So far, Hong Kong's annual car growth rate is 3.4%. After surveying from 2003 to 2013, the number of cars in Hong Kong has increased from 524,000 to 681,000. As of 2016, the car growth has reached 870,000 due to the rapid growth of vehicles. The traffic pressure of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel is too large and only a charging policy can be implemented.</p>

                                <p>Secondly, due to the increase of vehicles, some vehicles have been driven too fast, causing accidents in the underwater tunnel. In 2016, the total number of accidents in the Cross-Harbour Tunnel has reached 64. Many accidents are fatal. It can be said that this is very scary. of.</p>

                                <p>Then there is environmental problem. Due to the convenience of transportation, there are too many people coming and going to Kowloon, Hong Kong to see the beauty of the two places. Since most of the people are coming by car, 90% of the air pollutants are from these vehicles. There are 33% of municipal solid waste, and it can be said that the harm to the environment is also great!</p>

                                    <p>This urban transformation helps to improve the livability of the entire city.This project is about repairing an important waterway in Melbourne.It is in the Melbourneâ€™s west. Although the renovation has started in the beginning of 2017, the project has been approved for strategic planning and design for sustainable stormwater management in the end of 2018.Some people said that this project which will eventually cost 12.9 million dollars is a waste that the government can use to provide more convenient services to the public.As a former industrial city, the environmental protection is a very important thing for the city.As a remnant of the rapid development of the industry, they undoubtedly have a huge negative impact on the livability of the city.It used to consist entirely of cement and steel. The water in the waterways was also muddy, trees and animals have not been here anymore. Like the first picture.The project restored about 88 thousand square meters of land by planting local virgin forests along the creek, while returning to the more natural state from the existing concrete-renovated drainage channel. Therefore, the number of trees will increase significantly about 2200, which also gives people a place for better outdoor activities..It is also a good way to avoid using the air conditioning for healthy body of us.And more trees and natural rivers also mean that the cleaning and reuse and storage of rainwater is no longer a problemThere is no doubt that it will no longer be an industrial drain, it will become a natural river.By using recycled rainwater to irrigate local sports fields and grasslands, water resources are saved and the environment is protected.So the water in the river will become more abundant and clean. Like the second picture.It will provide a more natural open space for the local community, and birds and some animals will return to the land. The restoration of Upper Stony Creek will create a quality city view.This reforestation project will provide a cool place for hot weather that will directly improve the health and well-being of the community.More fresh air and better weather conditions can make people's living environment more natural and healthy for people in this area.A more natural living environment will also improve people's quality of life, and it will attract more people to live here. Like the third picture.The transformation of the industrial zone into the natural direction has also brought the distance between the city and nature closer, which undoubtedly improves the livability of the city.</p>

                            <p>Due to the rapid population growth in Hong Kong, the traffic pressure has also increased. After the completion of the Hong Kong Cross-Harbour Tunnel project, the traffic pressure in Hong Kong has been greatly eased. This has made it easier for people to travel to and from Kowloon and Hong Kong. It has shortened the time between the two places and is also connected. The main financial and commercial areas on both sides of Victoria Harbour have also improved the economic capabilities of the two places, which not only eased economic pressure, but also improved urban capacity. It is an important step in urban transformation, which is precisely the urban transformation. The transformation of transportation, and the road to urban transformation in Melbourne is different. Because Melbourne is an industrial city, his urban transformation path is more focused on environmental protection. The project is to transform the greening problem in western Melbourne, mainly to make a long The 1.2-kilometer concrete ditch turns into a natural creek. The project can restore the original ecological environment and return the original animals to the habitat. The project can also improve the community's environment, which is also a milestone for Melbourne's environmental protection work. It belongs to the environmental transformation in urban transformation, which is related to the Hong Kong Harbour Tunnel.<br><br>
